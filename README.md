# Linux_machine_router

1. A standard Linux machine has the ability to act as a router.

- Write a test plan to test this router. 

- Write a script to automate a small sample set of at least 5 test cases. Example test cases to automate could be ping verification, interface state, arp table entries etc.

- All the Test cases and the details need to be captured in JSON, XML, YAML or any such standard format of which select set of test cases will be automated.

- Script should read the above test case file and execute the test cases and print the number of test cases passed and failed at the end.

- Script should log the results in a log file. 
 

2. Write a script in python to create exactly 1000 TCP sessions. Feel free to use any opensource tools to generate the traffic (iperf, ab etc).
